There will not be any code implementation on this week's assignment!

1. Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:

First, let's define what is a linked list, a stack, and a queue so that the concepts are clear before we design the code implementation.

Linked list: A linked list is a list that consists of nodes. Each node contains a data element and a pointer that points to the next node. See on image below:

Stack:
Queue:

  - What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?
  - What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?

2. Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):
  - What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?
  - What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?**
